Description : The glibc package contains standard libraries which are used by
            : multiple programs on the system. In order to save disk space and
            : memory, as well as to make upgrading easier, common system code is
            : kept in one place and shared between programs. This particular
            : package contains the most important sets of shared libraries: the
            : standard C library and the standard math library. Without these
            : two libraries, a Linux system will not function.
